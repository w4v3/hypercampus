    "## The nature of forgetting\n",
    "\n",
    "HyperCampus relies on the idea that forgetting is primarily caused by increased difficulty of access to a memory rather than damage to the memory itself (see [Rose et al. 2016](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6316/1136) for a nice neurological study). A memory is constantly threatened by the danger of some of its access pathways being blocked by other memories. If we think in terms of discrete events that reduce accessability of a memory, we might expect that such an event happens at a constant rate. Then, the time until such an event happens is distributed according to an exponential distribution\n",
    "$$p(t) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n",
    "with a rate parameter $\\lambda$. Then, the share of connections that are blocked by a time $T$ is given by\n",
    "$$\\int_0^T p(t) dt = 1-e^{-\\lambda t}.$$\n",
    "Thus, the \"intactness\" of a memory by the time $t$ can be described as\n",
    "$$\\rho(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}.$$\n",
    "We will call $\\rho$ the *retrievability* of the memory. Now there are two fundamentally different interpretations of $\\rho$:\n",
    "1. It indicates the *probability of recall*, meaning that if we test a person on a certain memorized item after a time $t$, the probability that they will answer correctly is $\\rho(t)$. In this case, recall is binary: An item is either recalled or not. Access to it is either entirely possible with probability $\\rho$ or impossible with probability $1-\\rho$.\n",
    "1. It is a measure of *retrieval effort*, describing how difficult it is to retrieve a memory, by the time that has to be spent on retrieving it. Access to the memory becomes progressively more difficult, as described by $\\rho(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all spaced repetition systems use interpretation 1. Indeed, it is empirically well documented that recall probability decays along a negative exponential in time as in the above formula, at least for simple memories. However, it is usually difficult to measure the probability of recall directly, since the result of an observation is either success or failure. When conducting a study, recall probability can be determined because a big amount of data is available, but on a trial-to-trial basis as in individual spaced repetition, this is in my eyes unreliable. Sometimes an item isn't recalled even though retrievability was high (*tip of the tongue* phenomenon), and sometimes an item is successfully recalled even though retrievability was low (by spending a lot of time trying to retrieve it).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, HyperCampus relies on the second interpretation. The continuous grade that the user provides about how difficult the retrieval was is mapped onto a retrievability estimate, irrespective of whether the item was recalled or not. We will discuss empirical evidence for this later. For now, note that both interpretations can be reconciled if access to memory is interpreted as being a statistical search: Low $\\rho$ indicates difficult access to the memory (interpretation 1), meaning that the search is more likely to be aborted early (interpretation 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, HyperCampus still calculates the probability of recall as $\\rho$, but $\\rho$ is measured as retrieval effort. Note that the formula for $\\rho(t)$ depends on an unknown rate parameter $\\lambda$. Let us assume for a second that we know how to estimate $\\lambda$, then the algorithm for a given item works like this:\n",
    "1. Estimate $\\lambda$ for that item and derive the retrievability formula $\\rho(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}$ for it.\n",
    "1. To find the point in time when probability of forgetting rises above the $\\varphi$ requested by the user, solve $\\rho(T) = \\varphi$ for $T$:\n",
    "$$T = -\\frac{\\ln{\\varphi}}{\\lambda}$$\n",
    "1. Test the user on the item after time $T$. If the grade doesn't match the expected retrievability of $1-\\varphi$, update the estimate of $\\lambda$ and start again at 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us have a closer look at $\\lambda$. It indicates how fast $\\rho$ decays. To be precise, after a time $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$, $\\rho$ has fallen to $\\frac{1}{e}$ of its original value. Obviously, $\\lambda$ is different for different items stored in memory: Some remain accessible longer than others. A bit less obviously, $\\lambda$ is not constant. Spaced repetition is based on the assumption that reviews can be more and more spaced out over time, indicating that $\\lambda$ (the decay rate) should decrease if we have reviewed an item more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the difficulty lies in predicting how $\\lambda$ changes with reviews. Literature indicates that effects on $\\lambda$ are generally multiplicative, e.g. $\\lambda$ might be halved by a review. To convert multiplication to addition, we will not deal with $\\lambda$ directly but with a quantity\n",
    "$$\\sigma = -\\ln\\lambda,$$\n",
    "which, following [Piotr Woźniak from SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_component_model_of_memory), I will refer to as *stability*, as it measures how stable the storage of a memory is (however, note that SuperMemo's stability is a different but related quantity, namely $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$). The stability is not constant over time, rather, it is changed by reviews depending on various factors."

    "## Estimating the stability\n",

    "After deriving the current retrievability $\\rho$ from a grade given by the user, we could update the stability estimate by simply setting\n",

    "However, this would not be a very stable procedure, because the measurement of $\\rho$ is supposedly not very precise. We can solve this problem by using Bayesian inference and probability distributions instead.\n",

When we quiz the user another interval $t'$ later, we would like to know if our stability estimate was accurate and update it accordingly. To this end, we assume that there is a relationship between the observed grade $g$ and the true stability before review,\n",

    "$$p(\\sigma_{+}\\mid\\sigma_-) = \\mathcal{N}(\\sigma_-+f_t(\\sigma_-),\\omega^f)$$\n",
    "(see next section for a discussion of this update). The stability supposedly remains constant between reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we need to assume that we actually know the stability increase function $f_t$. If that's the case, we can update our stability estimate $\\widehat{\\sigma}_+$ using an [extended Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter). This is a Kalman filter that works for nonlinear systems by local linearization, which works well in this case because $h$ is, in fact, very well approximated by a (piecewise) linear function, and $f$ is linear, as we will see shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It goes like this: Given an estimate $\\widehat{\\sigma}_-$ together with a variance estimate $\\widehat{\\Psi}^\\sigma_-$ for $\\widehat{\\sigma}_-$, we first make a prediction for the stability after $t'$ (before the review):\n",
    "$$\\widehat{\\sigma}_{+\\mid -} = \\widehat{\\sigma}_- + f_t(\\widehat{\\sigma}_-)$$\n",

    "$$\\tilde{\\Psi}^\\sigma = h_{t'}'^2\\widehat{\\Psi}^\\sigma_{+\\mid -}+\\omega^g$$\n",

    "## The stability increase formula\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "However, there are many more factors that influence the change in stability than just whether or not the review was successful. Let us consider that memories are encoded in [*engrams*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engram_%28neuropsychology%29), as certain cellular structures, in the brain, and that $\\rho$ indicates how easily the engram can be accessed. Which factors contribute to $\\sigma$?\n",
    "* *synaptic strength*: how strong is the connection of the engram to the rest of the brain via its synapses?\n",
    "* *complexity*: how many cells or synapses are necessary to encode the knowledge?\n",

    "\n",
    "A common theory on the neurobiology of learning is that it is mediated by [long-term potentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation), which describes the phenomenon that synaptic strength increases between two cells after certain patterns of activation of the two. Thus, exposition to a fact, for example in a review, should increase the stability of the memory. Supposedly, there is a maximum possible synaptic strength, and in analogy to the [Rescorla-Wagner model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescorla%E2%80%93Wagner_model), I hypothesize that\n",

    "\n",
    "*Complexity* and *integratedness* are certainly hard to quantify, but their effect on stability might be characterized. Complexity depends on the item and probably does not change significantly over time. As complex items are supposed to have a lot of connections that would have to be strengthened for an increase in stability, complexity probably cuts down stability increase by the number of required connections. Integratedness, on the other hand, can change in time facilitate stability enhancement: For example, making up a mnemonic might lead to better integration of a memory into the existing concepts, countering the effect that the complexity might have. Now because this is all very speculative, I did not try to model these considerations explicitly. Rather, I included a factor $\\alpha$ in the model that scales the stability increase and is supposed to depend on the individual relationship between learner and item that can change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional empirical evidence about the nature of stability increase comes from the *retrieval effort hypothesis*, according to which facts are learnt more efficiently when retrieval was difficult. This suggests that stability increase might depend inversely on retrievability,\n",

    "The above version of the algorithm does not differentiate between successful and unsuccessful reviews, since the retrievability is determined from the retrieval effort grading alone. Intuitively, it seems that items that were forgotten should be reviewed again after a short interval. Empirical evidence on this is inconclusive:\n",
    "* Retrieval attempts enhance learning regardless of whether they were successful or not. Attempting to retrieve an item from memory and subsequent activation of it seems to strenghten the relevant connections, whether the activation was triggered from \"inside\" (by finding it on one's own) or \"outside\" (by being told the solution).\n",

    "Now the interesting question would be the combination of the two: Does the gain of learning in unsuccessful retrieval attempts correlate with retrieval effort? I couldn't find any study that addressed this question. Also, none of the studies I have seen on this so far have investigated whether these effects also hold true for long intervals (such as months or years). Therefore, it might not be wise to treat lapses entirely on the basis of these findings.\n",

    "HyperCampus will try to find out about this question by evaluating user performance for successful and unsuccessful retrieval attempts separately. In practice, this means that there are two different $\\beta$ parameters for the model, i.e. the parameter controlling the influence of $\\rho$ on the stability increase, that the algorithm uses in its inference process. Future evaluation of the converged parameters might help to reveal the quantitative role of memory retrieval success in learning.\n",

    "In my eyes, spaced repetition works well for consolidating items in memory, but not so well for learning them initially. This may also apply to relearning lapsed cards. Thus, the default mode of the algorithm is to relay the responsibility for learning and relearning items to the user (but, see the [user guide](user_guide.md) for some options to facilitate acquisition)."
